Linux is fun! Huhhh. OK so you don’t believe me. Mind me at the end of this article you will have to believe that Linux is actually a fun box.

Linux Funny Commands
20 Linux Funny Commands
1. Command: sl (Steam Locomotive)
You might be aware of command ‘ls‘ the list command and use it frequently to view the contents of a folder but because of miss-typing sometimes you would result in ‘sl‘, how about getting a little fun in terminal and not “command not found“.

Install sl

root@tecmint:~# apt-get install sl 		(In Debian like OS)
root@tecmint:~# yum -y install sl 		(In Red Hat like OS)
Output

root@tecmint:~# sl
sl funny command
sl command
This command works even when you type ‘LS‘ and not ‘ls‘.

2. Command: telnet
No! No!! it is not as much complex as it seems. You would be familiar with telnet. Telnet is a text-oriented bidirectional network protocol over network. Here is nothing to be installed. What you should have is a Linux box and a working Internet.

root@tecmint:~# telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
telnet command
telnet command
3. Command: fortune
what about getting your random fortune, sometimes funny in terminal.

Install fortune

root@tecmint:~# apt-get install fortune 	(for aptitude based system)
root@tecmint:~# yum install fortune 		(for yum based system)
root@tecmint:~# fortune
You're not my type.  For that matter, you're not even my species!!!

You worry too much about your job.  Stop it.  You are not paid enough to worry.
Your love life will be... interesting.
4. Command: rev (Reverse)

6. Command: script
OK fine this is not a command and a script but it is nice.

6Ã—1=6	6Ã—2=12	6Ã—3=18	6Ã—4=24	6Ã—5=30	6Ã—6=36	
7Ã—1=7	7Ã—2=14	7Ã—3=21	7Ã—4=28	7Ã—5=35	7Ã—6=42	7Ã—7=49	
8Ã—1=8	8Ã—2=16	8Ã—3=24	8Ã—4=32	8Ã—5=40	8Ã—6=48	8Ã—7=56	8Ã—8=64

7. Command: Cowsay
An ASCII cow in terminal that will say what ever you want.

Install Cowsay

root@tecmint:~# apt-get install cowsay 		(for Debian based OS)
root@tecmint:~# yum install cowsay		(for Red Hat based OS)
Output

root@tecmint:~# cowsay I Love nix 
____________
< I Love nix >
------------
\   ^__^
\  (oo)\_______
(__)\       )\/\
||----w |
||     ||
How about pipelineing ‘fortune command‘, described above with cowsay?

root@tecmint:~# fortune | cowsay 
_________________________________________
/ Q: How many Oregonians does it take to  \
| screw in a light bulb? A: Three. One to |
| screw in the light bulb and two to fend |
| off all those                           |
|                                         |

-----------------------------------------
\   ^__^
\  (oo)\_______
(__)\       )\/\
||----w |
||     ||
Note: ‘|‘ is called pipeline instruction and it is used where the output of one command needs to be the input of another command. In the above example the output of ‘fortune‘ command acts as an input of ‘cowsay‘ command. This pipeline instruction is frequently used in scripting and programming.

xcowsay is a graphical program which response similar to cowsay but in a graphical manner, hence it is X of cowsay.

apt-get install xcowsay
yum install xcowsay
Output

root@tecmint:~# xcowsay I Love nix
install xcowsay 
xcowsay command
cowthink is another command just run “cowthink Linux is sooo funny” and see the difference in output of cowsay and cowthink.

apt-get install cowthink
yum install cowthink
Output

root@tecmint:~# cowthink ....Linux is sooo funny
_________________________

8. Command: yes
It is funny but useful as well, specially in scripts and for System Administrators where an automated predefined response can be passed to terminal or generated.

root@tecmint:~# yes I Love Linux
I Love Linux
I Love Linux
I Love Linux
I Love Linux
I Love Linux
I Love Linux
I Love Linux
I Love Linux

I Love Linux
I Love Linux

Note: (Till you interrupt i.e ctrl+c).

9. Command: toilet
what? Are u kidding, huhh no! Definitely not, but for sure this command name itself is too funny, and I don’t know from where this command gets it’s name.

Install toilet

root@tecmint:~# apt-get install toilet 
root@tecmint:~# yum install toilet
Output

root@tecmint:~# toilet tecmint 
mmmmmmm                        "             m                               
#     mmm    mmm   mmmmm  mmm    m mm   mm#mm          mmm    mmm   mmmmm 
#    #"  #  #"  "  # # #    #    #"  #    #           #"  "  #" "#  # # # 
#    #""""  #      # # #    #    #   #    #           #      #   #  # # # 
#    "#mm"  "#mm"  # # #  mm#mm  #   #    "mm    #    "#mm"  "#m#"  # # #
It even offers some kind of color and fonts style.

Output

root@tecmint:~# cmatrix

Install oneko

root@tecmint:~# apt-get install oneko
root@tecmint:~# yum install oneko
Output

Note: Once you close the terminal from which oneko was run, jerry will disappear, nor will start at start-up. You can add the application to start up and continue enjoying.

12. Fork Bomb
This is a very nasty piece of code. Run this at your own risk. This actually is a fork bomb which exponentially multiplies itself till all the system resource is utilized and the system hangs. (To check the power of above code you should try it once, but all at your own risk, close and save all other programs and file before running fork bomb).

root@tecmint:~# :(){ :|:& }:
13. Command: while
The below “while” command is a script which provides you with colored date and file till you interrupt (ctrl + c). Just copy and paste the below code in terminal.

root@tecmint:~# while true; do echo "$(date '+%D %T' | toilet -f term -F border --gay)"; sleep 1; done
Linux while command
Linux while command
Note: The above script when modified with following command, will gives similar output but with a little difference, check it in your terminal.

root@tecmint:~# while true; do clear; echo "$(date '+%D %T' | toilet -f term -F border --gay)"; sleep 1; done
14. Command: espeak
Just Turn the Knob of your multimedia speaker to full before pasting this command in your terminal and let us know how you felt listening the god’s voice.

root@tecmint:~# yum install espeak

root@tecmint:~# url -u YourUsername:YourPassword -d status="Your status message" http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml
18. ASCIIquarium
How it will be to get an aquarium in terminal.

root@tecmint:~# apt-get install libcurses-perl

root@tecmint:~# cd asciiquarium_1.1/
root@tecmint:~# cp asciiquarium /usr/local/bin
root@tecmint:~# chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/asciiquarium
And finally run “asciiquarium” or “/usr/local/bin/asciiquarium“ in terminal without quotes and be a part of magic that will be taking place in front of your eyes.

root@tecmint:~# asciiquarium
install aquarium
aquarium command

20. Linux Tweaks
It is time for you to have some one liner tweaks.

root@tecmint:~# touch girls\ boo** 
touch: cannot touch `girls boo**': Permission denied
root@tecmint:~# nice man woman
No manual entry for woman
root@tecmint:~# ^How did the sex change operation go?^ 
bash: :s^How did the sex change operation go?^ : substitution failed
root@tecmint:~# %blow 
bash: fg: %blow: no such job
root@tecmint:~# make love 
make: *** No rule to make target `love'.  Stop.
$ [ whereis my brain?                    
sh: 2: [: missing ]
% man: why did you get a divorce? 
man:: Too many arguments.
% !:say, what is saccharine? 
Bad substitute.
server@localhost:/srv$ \(- 
bash: (-: command not found
Linux is sexy: who | grep -i blonde | date; cd ~; unzip; touch; strip; finger; mount; gasp; yes; uptime; umount; sleep (If you know what i mean)

Reading package lists… Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information… Done
Package funny-manpages is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
However the following packages replace it:

E: Package ‘funny-manpages’ has no installation candidate

Hi nice work. I liked the linux tweaks that you had mentioned. Anyways I was not able to install bb command on my fedora-22 OS; it was giving a comment ‘bb’ package not found. Please you give me some idea for installing it.

Ravi Saive  September 9, 2016 at 10:52 am
@Madhu,

May be the bb package not available from default Fedora repositories, you can compile it from source too..

Is it possible that some of this didn’t work in zsh?

Ravi Saive  June 27, 2016 at 11:16 am
@Aargon,

No idea, actually never tried these Linux funny tools on Zsh shell, but I think you right, some of might not work on zsh shell, but still I think you should give a try each and test it..

Hey Hi,

nicely written but there’s a typo…

# apt-get insatll cowthink
It was written insatll … instead of “install”

Ravi Saive  May 16, 2016 at 11:18 am
@jtw,

Thanks for pointing out that typo, we’ve corrected in the article..

Just a little mistake I noticed..
At command 11 (oneko) -> the Install part, you typed “Install cmatrix” insted of “install oneko”

Great Article, I laughed way too much at this one:

man:: Too many arguments.
