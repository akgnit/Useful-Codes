Any frameworks(Hibernate, JPA, etc) is fine.

SAVING:
Always Keep the date column in Entity as java.sql.Timestamp
While storing the time in ur database, it will always save in ur database as UTC unless you have moved ur db in some other zone.
No worries, for that as well. 
If your system is in EDT and db is in UTC, it will store the date as <<UR_DATE_TIMESTAMP>>+4:00 since EDT is UTC-4 so it will add 4 and store as UTC.
If your system is in EDT and db is in EDT(UTC-4), it will store the date as <<UR_DATE_TIMESTAMP>>+4:00+4:00. This additional +4 is because your db is also lagged by UTC.

FETCHING:
You will get the same datetime in ur application unless you change ur server timezone.
